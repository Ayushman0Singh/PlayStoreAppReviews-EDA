Exploring app review data to understand factors responsible for app engagement and success
The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market. Business owners can also use this data to hire the right developers.  Investors looking to invest in app development companies could derive key insights from the data. As a developer, you would be interested in what are the key factors responsible for a successful application and how to make sure your app is differentiable and unique among the plethora of applications available on the play store. For this case, The KPI to measure for the success of an application is the rating it receives from its users.

Next, I did some data cleaning and data wrangling on the given data set. After that when all the data was in the correct format and usable, I moved on to the analysis and visualisation. 

In this step, I looked at app rating and its distribution individually and along with other variables. Then I tried to look at the behaviour of app rating with other numeric and categorical features and see if a particular trend or pattern emerges. 

Next, I took the top 90 percentile of the apps to determine top-rated apps and considered them as a benchmark for a successful application. I applied a minimum threshold of 1000 reviews to make sure that these applications have a good amount of users, and the sample size of the users is not very small. I compared the top-rated applications to all the applications to determine what factors differentiate them.

To conclude, I found that the price of an application is the most important factor in determining the rating of an app. The most expensive app among the top-rated apps was 5 dollars. Also, none of the highest-paid apps belonged in the top-rated apps. I also found that the size of the app plays no role in determining the success of an application. I also did some sentiment analysis among different categories of apps to end the analysis.
